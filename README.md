# pandas-challenge

so here is the issue: I have left myself stuck on one thing for 10 hours and only in the past hour have I kind of fixed it. As a result, I have had to cobble what I have now, so in it's state, it cannot be more than 30% complete. Besides the fact there are less than 10 minutes to submit, I have been lacking in sleep, so I will have to take the low grade now and hope whoever is grading will allow me to do a future resubmission to possible raise the grade above at least 60. Until then, here is that mess.
